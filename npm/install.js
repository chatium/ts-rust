// Postinstall of the goport `typescript` and `tsc-rs` packages: lib/install.js. Go's package has
// no install script; this is the only file the port adds to Go's layout.
//
// The bin (bin/tsc, or bin/tsc-rs) is Go's JS launcher (packages/typescript/bin/tsc): it starts
// Node, finds the platform package and execs its native tsc. The Node start costs about 22 ms on
// every run. On POSIX this script rewrites the bin as a sh and JS polyglot:
//
//   #!/bin/sh
//   ":" //; p=$0; ...; t="${p%/*}/../../@typescript/typescript-linux-x64/lib/tsc"; ...; exec "$t" "$@"
//   import "../lib/tsc.js";
//
// sh (the shebang, npm's .bin symlink, pnpm's shim) runs line 2, where `":" //` is the no-op `:`.
// It finds the bin's real dir from $0 and execs the native tsc by its path relative to that dir,
// so a moved project still works. Node (`node bin/tsc`, tools that start a bin with
// process.execPath) reads line 2 as a string and a comment and runs line 3, Go's launcher, as
// with Go. The exec path keeps the real path of the native tsc in the platform package, where it
// reads the lib files (Go's noembed build).
//
// The relative path is fixed at install. pnpm keeps the result of a postinstall in its store (the
// side-effects cache) and gives it to a later install of the same package in another layout
// (hoisted, isolated or the global virtual store), where the path can name no file. Then sh does
// not find an executable there and runs this file with Node (`exec node "$p"`), which runs Go's
// launcher, as with Go.
//
// To find the real dir, sh first tries npm's node_modules/.bin/tsc link, with no fork: when $0 is
// a symlink and ../typescript/bin/tsc from its dir (npm's link target) is the same file (test
// -ef) and not a symlink, that path is the bin. Else it follows $0 one link at a time, as pnpm's
// shim does (old macOS has no `readlink -f`). A readlink is a fork and an exec, about 1 ms on the
// .bin path, which runs for every npx and package.json script.
//
// Every failure keeps the JS launcher, which still works. It stays on Windows (npm's cmd
// shim runs bin/tsc with Node), under Yarn (Yarn runs bins with Node), outside a
// node_modules dir (do not rewrite a source checkout), and when the native tsc does not run
// here or reports another version than this package.
