//! The dispatch-thread work queue. No Go source: this is the port's model
//! for Go goroutines and `time.AfterFunc` callbacks that touch
//! language-service state (PORTING.md "Threads" and "Go runtime").
//!
//! One thread (the LSP dispatch thread) owns all `Rc`/`RefCell` state. A Go
//! `go f()` over that state becomes `local::go(Box::new(f))`, and a Go
//! `time.AfterFunc(d, f)` over that state becomes `local::after_func`. Both
//! run on the dispatch thread when it calls `run_pending`, in the order they
//! became ready: a job when it is queued, a timer when it is due.
//!
//! Contract with the dispatch loop: the server calls `set_waker(f)` once. A
//! timer thread calls the waker when a `LocalTimer` becomes due. Each
//! thread that arms a `LocalTimer` gets one timer thread for all its timers,
//! made at its first arm. It ends when that thread ends. The
//! dispatch loop calls `run_pending()` after each message and after each
//! wake-up. Go `WaitForBackgroundTasks` (`background::Queue::wait`) calls
//! `run_pending()`, and `wait_pending()` while a queued task sleeps on a
//! timer, until the queue's tasks have finished.
//!
//! A job that waits for another thread is `post_later(f)`: the other
//! thread posts the `Send` handle it returns once, when its work ends, and
//! `f` then runs in `run_pending` like a `go` job (Go: a goroutine that a
//! channel send makes runnable). Nothing runs or polls before the post.
//!
//! Idle work (`go_idle`) is a second, separate queue for long work that
//! sends nothing to the client (the auto-import warm). The dispatch loop
//! runs it with `run_idle()` only when no message waits: at once or after a
//! quiet period with no message, as the job asks (`IdleStart`), so it does
//! not delay a request that has arrived. `run_pending` does not run it.
//!
//! Garbage (`drop_later`) is a third queue, for large frees that Go's
//! garbage collector does in the background (a released program, the
//! parse tasks of a load). On a thread whose dispatch loop called
//! `keep_garbage`, the values wait until the loop calls `drop_garbage`
//! after a message, so the free is not in the answer time. On other
//! threads `drop_later` drops at once. `drop_after_pause` uses this queue
//! only for the first release after a client pause (`note_message_gap`),
//! and only when the client has not sent its next edit yet
//! (`set_stream_check`). It drops at once otherwise, so only the releases
//! of one message wait (of one pipelined burst on an API connection: see
//! `drop_after_pause`).
//!
//! The queues are per thread: `go`, `post_later`, `go_idle`, `after_func`,
//! `run_pending`, `run_idle`, `drop_later` and `drop_garbage` act on the
//! calling thread's queues.
